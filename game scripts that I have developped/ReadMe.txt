This folder gathers 50% of the scripts that I have developped since I started self learning Unity. 
There are definitely more scripts that I have done to kill time but I either deleted them in the past or cannot find where they at right now.
The most recent one that I'm currently working on is RoomGenerator.cs.

You can look up in each folder to see more details about these scripts and how they work.
